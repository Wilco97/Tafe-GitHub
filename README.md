# Tafe-GitHub
this is the edt page 

it allwos you to preview all the changes that you are making before you save 

it also allows you to chance spaces & tab size 

however instead of save it commit changes it also allows you to creat a new branch directly from the edit page and to start a pull request

which will be shown later in the steps.
